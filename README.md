# SendMail
Hey! This project uses Python's GUI module tkinter and mail transfer module SMTPlib to implement a GUI that can be used to send a mail.

CRITICAL ReadMe: Python's SMTPlib requires you to enable access to 'Less secure apps' on your Gmail account. This is to protect your 
Email being exploited. But this project implements Transport Layer Security (TLS Security) encryption and peer authentication to keep your
details safe. But I would reccomend you to turn off the access to 'Less secure apps' right after you're done with using this project.

How to enable access to 'Less secure apps':
